I've decided to open source the [repository](https://github.com/mdryden/dryden.dev) for this site, because I think it's a pretty good example of how to hit the ground running with Hugo by using GitHub actions to continuously deploy to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

Detailed instructions including DNS and bucket configuration can be found [here, in the readme](https://github.com/mdryden/dryden.dev/blob/main/README.md).
